# Copilot Enterprise Workshop Orchestrator

### Deterministic Azure Landing Zone Governance — Multi-Turn, Tool-Restricted, Enterprise Guardrailed

This project implements a GitHub Copilot SDK–powered **enterprise workshop orchestrator** over a deterministic Azure Landing Zone (ALZ) governance engine.

> **Copilot does not score controls.**
> **Copilot does not mutate the environment.**

Copilot acts as a multi-turn orchestration layer, selecting from explicit, guardrailed tools that execute deterministic governance logic and return structured, traceable evidence.

---

## What Makes This Enterprise-Grade

- **One-way data flow:** deterministic → AI
- **Tool-restricted execution surface**
- **No scoring modification**
- **No environment mutation**
- **No file writes outside `out/`**
- **Structured output validation**
- **Microsoft Learn grounding via MCP**

> **This is not a chatbot.**
>
> It is a controlled governance orchestration layer over live Azure telemetry.

---

## Deterministic Reasoning Foundation

The underlying assessment engine performs structured, multi-stage reasoning over live Azure telemetry:

1. Deterministic control evaluation
2. Dependency graph impact analysis
3. Initiative ordering based on structural constraints
4. Causal "why-risk" chain construction
5. Microsoft Learn–grounded remediation guidance

**The AI does not score. It reasons over scored evidence.**

### What the Engine Produces

- Scores every control in the [Azure Landing Zone Review Checklist](https://github.com/Azure/review-checklists) against live Azure telemetry
- Builds a dependency-ordered 30-60-90 transformation roadmap
- Performs causal "why-risk" analysis across domains
- Grounds remediation in official Microsoft Learn documentation

## Demo Walkthrough – Copilot-Orchestrated ALZ Workshop

The live workshop session below demonstrates Copilot SDK orchestration layered on top of a deterministic Azure Landing Zone assessment engine.

All reporting artifacts shown afterward are generated from deterministic governance logic.  
Copilot does **not** modify scoring or Azure state.

## Architectural Characteristics

| Principle | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Deterministic First** | All scoring, risk tiers, and control verdicts are computed from live Azure signals before AI executes |
| **Checklist-Grounded** | Every remediation item maps to an official Azure Review Checklist ID — no synthetic identifiers |
| **One-Way Data Flow** | AI consumes scored results but cannot modify deterministic outputs |
| **Schema-Enforced Output** | All AI responses are validated against JSON schemas before acceptance |
| **Documentation-Grounded** | Microsoft Learn MCP integration enriches outputs with official implementation guidance |
| **Traceable Deliverables** | CSA Workbook, HTML Report, and Run JSON preserve referential integrity end-to-end |


---

## End-to-End Reasoning Architecture

> **Architecture Principle — One-Way Data Flow**
>
> Deterministic assessment **feeds** the AI reasoning layer. Control verdicts and risk scores are final before AI executes.

### Copilot SDK Layer

The **Copilot SDK session** (`--workshop-copilot`) adds an interactive orchestration layer on top of the deterministic engine. It does **not** replace any of the pipeline above — it exposes it through a conversational interface with strict guardrails:

- **6 registered tools** — `run_scan`, `load_results`, `summarize_findings`, `generate_outputs`, `list_runs`, `compare_runs`
- **Session cache** — active run is remembered across turns; no re-loading required
- **Demo enforcement** — in demo mode, the fixture is always used regardless of model requests
- **Path confinement** — all file writes constrained to `out/`
- **Format allow-list** — only `html` and `excel` accepted
- **One-way data flow preserved** — Copilot consumes deterministic results but cannot modify scores or verdicts

### Data Collection

- Azure Resource Graph
- Policy + Compliance
- Defender for Cloud
- Management Group hierarchy

### Evaluation Engine

- Signal Bus routes platform telemetry → control evaluators
- ALZ control pack scoring → Pass / Fail / Partial / Manual
- Weighted maturity + risk model

### AI Reasoning Engine

| Pass | Name | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | **Roadmap & Initiatives** | 30-60-90 plan + initiative dependency graph |
| 2 | **Executive Briefing** | Top risks + maturity narrative |
| 3 | **Implementation Decision** | ALZ implementation pattern selection per initiative |
| 4 | **Sequence Justification** | Initiative ordering rationale + engagement recommendations |
| 5 | **Enterprise-Scale Readiness** | Readiness assessment against ALZ design areas |
| 6 | **Smart Questions** | Targeted discovery questions for the customer |
| 7 | **Implementation Backlog** | Per-initiative execution plans |
| 8 | **Microsoft Learn Grounding** | MCP SDK retrieval + ALZ-aware contextualisation |
| 9 | **Target Architecture** | Recommended architecture with execution units |
| 10 | **Critical Issues** | Top failing controls advisory with course of action |
| 11 | **Blocker Resolution** | Enterprise readiness blocker resolution summary |

### Why-Risk Agent (Deterministic Reasoning Layer)

- Failing controls → dependency graph impact
- Root cause → cascade effect
- Roadmap action that fixes it
- Microsoft Learn remediation reference

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Python** | 3.12 or later |
| **Azure CLI** | Installed and authenticated (`az login`) |
| **Azure Permissions** | Reader role (minimum) on target subscriptions. Management Group Reader for full hierarchy visibility. |
| **Azure OpenAI** | Required for AI features. Needs a `gpt-4.1` deployment (or any chat-completion model). Set env vars (see [Configuration](#configuration)). |
| **Git** | For cloning the repository |

### Required Azure Resource Providers

The tool queries Azure Resource Graph and ARM APIs using **read-only** calls. The following resource providers must be registered on the target subscriptions for all signals to return data. Most are registered by default on any subscription that has used the service — but if a signal returns empty, missing provider registration is the most common cause.

| Resource Provider | Signal(s) | Registered by Default? |
|---|---|---|
| `Microsoft.ResourceGraph` | All Resource Graph queries | ✅ Yes |
| `Microsoft.Network` | Firewalls, VNets, Public IPs, NSGs, Route Tables, Private Endpoints, DDoS | ✅ Yes |
| `Microsoft.Storage` | Storage Account Posture | ✅ Yes |
| `Microsoft.KeyVault` | Key Vault Posture | ✅ Yes |
| `Microsoft.Sql` | SQL Server Posture | Only if SQL is used |
| `Microsoft.Web` | App Service Posture | Only if App Service is used |
| `Microsoft.ContainerRegistry` | Container Registry Posture | Only if ACR is used |
| `Microsoft.ContainerService` | AKS Cluster Posture | Only if AKS is used |
| `Microsoft.RecoveryServices` | VM Backup Coverage | Only if Backup is configured |
| `Microsoft.Compute` | VM inventory (for backup coverage) | ✅ Yes |
| `Microsoft.Security` | Defender plans, Secure Score | ✅ Yes |
| `Microsoft.Authorization` | RBAC hygiene, Resource Locks, Policy assignments | ✅ Yes (built-in) |
| `Microsoft.PolicyInsights` | Policy compliance summary | ✅ Yes |
| `Microsoft.Management` | Management Group hierarchy | ✅ Yes |
| `Microsoft.Insights` | Diagnostics coverage | ✅ Yes |

To check registration status:

```bash
az provider show -n Microsoft.RecoveryServices --query "registrationState" -o tsv
```

To register a missing provider (requires Contributor or Owner):

```bash
az provider register -n Microsoft.RecoveryServices
```

> **Note:** If a resource type doesn't exist in the subscription (e.g., no AKS clusters), the evaluator returns **NotApplicable** — not an error. Missing provider registration only matters when you *have* those resources but the signal returns empty.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rebmid/Copilot-alz-workshop-orchestrator.git
cd Copilot-alz-workshop-orchestrator
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (this file is git-ignored):

```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<your-resource>.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

The tool expects a **`gpt-4.1`** deployment (or any chat-completion model) on the Azure OpenAI resource. See [Configuration](#configuration) for details.

> **Without these credentials**, the assessment still runs — all deterministic scoring, control evaluation, and data collection work normally. However, the 11-pass AI reasoning pipeline will be skipped (`⚠ AI skipped`), meaning these report sections will be empty:
> - 30-60-90 Transformation Roadmap
> - Executive Briefing & Top Business Risks
> - Enterprise-Scale Readiness & Blockers
> - Critical Issues & Course of Action
> - Workshop Decision Funnel smart questions
> - Microsoft Learn MCP grounding
>
> Use `--no-ai` to explicitly skip AI, or omit the `.env` file to skip silently.

### 5. Authenticate with Azure

```bash
az login
```

> For enterprise / multi-tenant engagements, see the **[CSA Mode](#csa-mode-enterprise-landing-zone-assessment)** workflow below — it covers tenant targeting, subscription scoping, and management-group selection.

### 6. Run the assessment

```bash
python scan.py                       # scans the default subscription
python scan.py --demo                # demo mode — no Azure connection
python scan.py --mg-scope <mg-id>    # scope to a management group (recommended for CSA)
```

See the **[CLI Reference](#cli-reference)** for all available modes and flags.

The tool will:

1. Discover your Azure execution context (tenant, subscriptions, identity)
2. Fetch the latest ALZ checklist from GitHub (~255 controls)
3. Run all evaluators against your environment
4. Score every control with weighted domain scoring
5. Run the 11-pass AI reasoning pipeline (requires `.env` — see step 4)
6. Ground recommendations in Microsoft Learn documentation via MCP
7. Output all artifacts to the `out/` directory

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | For AI features | Your Azure OpenAI resource endpoint URL (e.g. `https://myresource.openai.azure.com/`) |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` | For AI features | API key for the Azure OpenAI resource |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | For Copilot Workshop | Personal access token — alternatively, authenticate via `gh auth login` |

All variables can be set in a `.env` file in the project root (loaded automatically via `python-dotenv`) or as system environment variables.

### Azure OpenAI Model

The tool defaults to the **`gpt-4.1`** deployment name. To use a different model, modify the `AOAIClient` initialization in `ai/engine/aoai_client.py`.

### API Version

Default: `2024-02-15-preview`. Configurable in `AOAIClient.__init__()`.

## CLI Reference

### Demo Mode (No Azure Required)

```bash
python scan.py --demo                    # Demo mode — no Azure connection
```

Launch Copilot workshop (demo data):

```bash
python scan.py --workshop-copilot --demo
```

Launch Copilot workshop (live Azure environment):

```bash
python scan.py --workshop-copilot
```

---

### CSA Mode (Enterprise Landing Zone Assessment)

> **Recommended enterprise workflow** — scope to the customer's landing zone management group for a focused, performant assessment.

#### Step 1 — Authenticate to the Customer Tenant

```bash
az login --tenant <customer-tenant-id>
```

(Optional sanity check)

```bash
az account show --output table
```

Confirm:
- Correct tenant
- Correct subscription context

#### Step 2 — Scope to the Landing Zone Management Group

> Avoid `--tenant-wide` for enterprise tenants. Instead, scope to the landing zone management group for faster, targeted assessment.

```bash
python scan.py --mg-scope <landing-zone-mg-id>
```

#### Step 3 — Launch Workshop on the Completed Run

```bash
python scan.py --workshop-copilot --run-source out
```

Workshop mode reads the existing assessment results. No re-scan required — use `load_results` to pick up where the scan left off.

## Copilot Workshop Session

The workshop session provides an interactive, multi-turn Copilot experience with 6 guardrailed tools for running assessments, exploring findings, and generating customer-facing reports — all from a conversational interface.

> **Key principle:** Copilot orchestrates deterministic tools. It does not score controls, mutate the environment, or fabricate data. Every response is grounded in loaded assessment evidence.

### Demo Mode (no Azure connection required)

```bash
python scan.py --workshop-copilot --demo
```

Uses the bundled demo fixture (`demo/demo_run.json`) — no Azure credentials or Azure OpenAI needed. The demo fixture includes pre-computed AI output, so report sections like the roadmap and executive briefing are populated. Great for testing, demos, and learning the workflow.

> **Note:** Demo mode loads a static fixture. It does **not** run evaluators, the AI pipeline, or MCP grounding. To get fresh AI-enriched output, use live mode with `.env` configured.

### Live Mode (real Azure environment)

```bash
python scan.py --workshop-copilot
```

Runs against your authenticated Azure subscription. If `.env` is configured with Azure OpenAI credentials, the full 11-pass AI reasoning pipeline runs — otherwise AI is skipped and only deterministic scoring is produced.

> **Mode:** LIVE (authenticated against your Azure subscription)
>
> ⚠️ A full deterministic scan against a live tenant can take 5–10 minutes depending on tenant size and subscription count.
>
> **Best practice:** Run `run_scan` before the workshop or during a break. Use `list_runs` + `load_results` during live facilitation.

### Prerequisites

- **GitHub token** — either set `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var or authenticate via `gh auth login`
- **Azure CLI** (live mode only) — `az login` and confirm the correct subscription with `az account show`
- **Azure OpenAI** (live mode, for AI features) — `.env` file with `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` (see [Configuration](#configuration))

### Debug Mode

To see all SDK events during a session (useful for troubleshooting):

```powershell
$env:WORKSHOP_DEBUG = "1"
python scan.py --workshop-copilot --demo
```

### Workshop Tools

The session registers exactly 6 tools. Copilot selects tools based on your natural language prompts:

| Tool | Description | Parameters | Example Prompt |
|---|---|---|---|
| `run_scan` | Execute a deterministic ALZ assessment scan (subprocess-isolated) | `scope` (MG ID), `subscription` (sub ID), `tag` (label) | *"run a scan"* |
| `load_results` | Load a completed run into memory and return structured metadata | `run_id` (default: `latest`) | *"load the latest results"* |
| `summarize_findings` | Filter findings by design area, severity, or failure status | `design_area`, `severity`, `failed_only`, `limit` | *"show critical Security findings"* |
| `generate_outputs` | Produce HTML report or Excel workbook from a loaded run | `formats` (`html`, `excel`) | *"generate an HTML report and Excel workbook"* |
| `list_runs` | List available assessment runs in the run store | *(none)* | *"list all runs"* |
| `compare_runs` | Compare two assessment runs and produce a delta summary | `run_id_a`, `run_id_b` | *"compare the baseline run with the latest"* |

### Session Behavior

- **Session cache:** After `run_scan` or `load_results`, the active run is remembered — subsequent tool calls default to it
- **Demo enforcement:** In demo mode, `run_scan` always uses the demo fixture regardless of what the model requests
- **Format allow-list:** Only `html` and `excel` are accepted by `generate_outputs`
- **Path confinement:** All output files are written to `out/` — writes outside that directory are rejected at the code level

### Typical Workshop Flow

1. **"run a scan"** — executes the assessment (instant in demo, 5–10 min live)
2. **"load results"** — loads the run into the session
3. **"summarize findings"** — explore findings by design area or severity
4. **"generate an HTML report"** — produce the customer-facing deliverable
5. **"list all runs"** — browse available assessment snapshots in the run store
6. **"compare baseline with latest"** — produce a delta summary between two runs

### Example Prompts

```
Workshop> run a scan
Workshop> load the latest results
Workshop> show me all critical failures in Security
Workshop> what design areas have the most failures?
Workshop> summarize the Networking findings
Workshop> generate an HTML report and Excel workbook
Workshop> show failed controls in Identity with severity High
Workshop> list all runs
Workshop> compare the baseline run with the latest
```

---

## Output Artifacts

All outputs are written to the `out/` directory:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `run-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.json` | Complete assessment data — controls, scores, AI output, delta, execution context |
| `ALZ-Platform-Readiness-Report-{run_id}-SNNN.html` | Interactive executive HTML report with score breakdowns and gap analysis |
| `run-YYYYMMDD-HHMM_CSA_Workbook.xlsm` | 3-sheet CSA deliverable workbook — macro-enabled (see [CSA Workbook Deep Dive](#csa-workbook-deep-dive)) |
| `target_architecture.json` | Target architecture recommendation — derived from scored controls and checklist alignment, with component recommendations and Learn references |
| `preflight.json` | *(preflight mode only)* Access probe results |

Additionally, `assessment.json` is written to the project root as a convenience copy.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection

The **collectors** module queries Azure APIs via Resource Graph, Defender, Policy, and Management Group endpoints to gather raw infrastructure data:

- **Resource Graph** — VNets, firewalls, public IPs, NSGs, route tables, storage accounts, Key Vaults, private endpoints, diagnostic settings, and more
- **Defender** — security score, coverage tier, recommendations
- **Policy** — policy definitions, assignments, and compliance state
- **Management Groups** — full hierarchy tree

All queries use `AzureCliCredential` — the same identity you authenticated with via `az login`.

### 2. Evaluation & Scoring

The **Signal Bus** architecture routes collected data through registered evaluators:

1. The ALZ checklist is fetched live from GitHub (~255 controls across Security, Networking, Governance, Identity, Data Protection, Resilience, Management, and Cost domains)
2. Each control is matched to an evaluator (or marked `Manual` if no automated check exists)
3. Evaluators emit `Pass`, `Fail`, `Partial`, or `Info` verdicts with evidence
4. The **scoring engine** applies domain weights and severity multipliers to produce a composite risk score
5. **Automation coverage** is calculated — typically 20-30% of controls have automated evidence, with the rest requiring customer conversation

### 3. AI Reasoning Engine

The AI layer is a **consumer** of the deterministic scoring output — it receives the scored controls, risk tiers, and evidence via `build_advisor_payload()` and produces advisory content. It never modifies or feeds back into deterministic verdicts.

When AI is enabled, a **multi-stage reasoning pipeline** runs against Azure OpenAI:

| Pass | Prompt | Output | max_tokens |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `roadmap.txt` | 30-60-90 transformation roadmap + named initiatives | 8000 |
| 2 | `exec.txt` | Executive briefing with business risk narrative | 8000 |
| 3 | `implementation_decision.txt` | ALZ implementation pattern selection per initiative | 8000 |
| 4 | `sequence_justification.txt` | Initiative ordering rationale + engagement recommendations | 8000 |
| 5 | `readiness.txt` | Enterprise-scale landing zone technical readiness | 8000 |
| 6 | `smart_questions.txt` | Customer discovery questions per domain | 8000 |
| 7 | `implementation.txt` × N | Implementation backlog (one item per initiative) | 4000 |
| 8 | *(MCP grounding)* | Learn doc refs, code samples, full-page enrichment | — |

The `AOAIClient` includes built-in resilience:
- **JSON fence stripping** — removes markdown ````json```` wrappers from model output
- **Truncation repair** — closes dangling brackets and strings when output is cut off
- **Retry loop** — up to 2 retries on invalid JSON responses

### 4. Grounding via Microsoft Learn MCP

The tool uses the **official MCP Python SDK** (Streamable HTTP transport) to connect to Microsoft's documentation API at `https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp`. The MCP server is declared in both `mcp.json` (root) and `.vscode/mcp.json` for VS Code integration.

| MCP Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `microsoft_docs_search` | Retrieves curated 500-token content chunks for each initiative |
| `microsoft_code_sample_search` | Fetches Bicep/Terraform code samples for infrastructure recommendations |
| `microsoft_docs_fetch` | Downloads full documentation pages as markdown for deep grounding |

**Resilience features** (implemented in `ai/mcp_retriever.py`):
- **REST fallback** — if MCP is unreachable, falls back to the public Learn search REST API (`https://learn.microsoft.com/api/search`)
- **Circuit breaker** — after 5 consecutive MCP failures, bypasses MCP for the remainder of the run
- **LRU cache** — deduplicates identical (tool, query) pairs within a single run
- **Bounded retry** — at most 1 retry for retryable errors (timeout, 429, 5xx) with jittered backoff
- **ALZ design-area-aware queries** — every search is scoped to an official ALZ design area for authoritative results

Grounding runs for:
- Each initiative in the transformation roadmap
- Each identified gap
- The target architecture

### 5. Report Generation

**HTML Report** (`report.html`):
- **Platform Readiness Snapshot** — tenant maturity score, automation coverage, enterprise-scale landing zone technical readiness
- **Landing Zone Adoption Blockers** — AI-identified barriers to ALZ adoption
- **Platform Risk Prioritization** — 5-tier risk classification (Critical → Hygiene) with confidence indicators
- **Highest-Impact Remediation Sequence** — prioritised initiative roadmap
- **Maturity After Roadmap Execution** — projected score improvement
- **Capability Unlock View** — capabilities enabled by completing each initiative
- **Domain Deep Dive** — per-section control tables split into ALZ Core and Operational Overlay, with automation %, critical fail counts, and risk sorting
- **Assessment Scope & Confidence** — subscription coverage, signal availability, and data-collection provenance
- **Customer Validation Required** — controls needing manual review or customer conversation
- **ALZ Design Area References** — links to official ALZ design area documentation

## CSA Workbook Deep Dive

The workbook is the primary **customer-facing deliverable** — a 3-sheet Excel file ready for CSA engagements:

### Sheet 0: `0_Executive_Summary`

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| **CSA Engagement Framing** | Engagement Objective, Key Message, Customer Outcome — ready-made talking points |
| **Assessment Metrics** | Total controls, automated %, pass/fail/partial counts, risk score |

## Why-Risk Reasoning (`--why`)

After a full assessment, drill into **why** a specific domain was flagged as the top risk:

```bash
python scan.py --why Networking --demo
```

This runs a **6-step causal reasoning pipeline** over the existing assessment data:

| Step | What it does |
|---|---|
| 1. **Find risk** | Matches the domain to a top business risk from the executive summary |
| 2. **Failing controls** | Extracts every Fail/Partial control tied to the risk |
| 3. **Dependency impact** | Queries the knowledge graph for downstream controls blocked by failures |
| 4. **Roadmap initiatives** | Finds transformation plan actions that address the affected controls |
| 5. **Learn grounding** | Attaches Microsoft Learn references to each initiative via MCP |
| 6. **AI causal explanation** | Sends the assembled evidence to the reasoning model for root-cause analysis |

The AI output includes:
- **Root cause** — why the domain is the top risk (current-state framing)
- **Business impact** — specific consequences tied to the evidence
- **Fix sequence** — ordered remediation steps with dependency rationale and Learn URLs
- **Cascade effect** — which downstream controls will automatically improve

Output is saved to `out/why-{domain}.json`. Use `--no-ai` to get the raw evidence payload without the AI narration.

## Preflight Mode

Before running a full assessment, validate your Azure permissions:

```bash
python scan.py --preflight
```

Preflight probes check:
- Subscription visibility
- Resource Graph query access
- Management group read access
- Defender API access
- Policy read access

Results are saved to `out/preflight.json` and printed to the console with pass/fail indicators.

## Scoring Model

### Domain Weights

| Domain | Weight | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Security | 1.5× | Highest impact on breach risk |
| Networking | 1.4× | Network segmentation is foundational |
| Identity | 1.4× | Identity is the new perimeter |
| Governance | 1.3× | Policy enforcement and compliance |
| Data Protection | 1.3× | Encryption, key management, data sovereignty |
| Resilience | 1.2× | Backup, disaster recovery, availability |
| Management | 1.1× | Operational visibility |
| Cost | 1.0× | Cost governance and optimization |

### Severity Weights

| Severity | Points |
|---|---|
| Critical | 6 |
| High | 5 |
| Medium | 3 |
| Low | 1 |
| Info | 0 |

### Status Multipliers

| Status | Multiplier | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Fail | 1.0× | Full risk weight applied |
| Partial | 0.6× | Reduced weight — some mitigation in place |
| Pass | 0× | No risk contribution |
| Manual | 0× | Not scored — requires customer discussion |

**Composite risk score** = Σ (severity_weight × status_multiplier × domain_weight) for all controls

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY / AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT not set` | Create a `.env` file with your Azure OpenAI credentials (see [Quick Start step 4](#4-configure-environment-variables)), or run with `--no-ai` to skip AI |
| Report sections are empty (roadmap, executive briefing, critical issues) | AI credentials are not configured. Create a `.env` file — without it, the 11-pass AI pipeline is silently skipped |
| `No subscriptions found` | Ensure `az login` succeeded and your identity has Reader on at least one subscription |
| `Management group hierarchy not visible` | Your identity needs Management Group Reader — the tool still works, but MG-related controls will be `Manual` |
| `Unterminated string` / JSON parse errors in AI output | The tool auto-repairs truncated JSON. If it persists, check your Azure OpenAI quota and model deployment name (`gpt-4.1`) |
| `MCP connection failed` | The tool falls back to the public Learn search API automatically. No action needed. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Ensure your virtual environment is activated and `pip install -r requirements.txt` completed successfully |
| `az: command not found` | Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) |
| Slow execution | Large tenants take longer. Use `--tenant-wide` only when needed. AI passes add ~60-90s. |
| Workshop session: `GITHUB_TOKEN` errors | Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var with a personal access token, or run `gh auth login` |

## Deployment

This tool is designed to run **locally** on a CSA's workstation — it is not a hosted service.

### Running in CI/CD

If you want to run assessments in a pipeline (e.g., scheduled governance scans):

```bash
# Authenticate with a service principal
az login --service-principal -u $APP_ID -p $SECRET --tenant $TENANT_ID

# Run assessment with no interactive prompts
python scan.py --no-ai --no-html
```

> **Note:** The Copilot workshop session (`--workshop-copilot`) requires an interactive terminal and a GitHub token — it is not suitable for headless/CI execution.

## Responsible AI

### Transparency

- **AI does not score controls.** All control verdicts (`Pass`, `Fail`, `Partial`, `Manual`) are computed deterministically from live Azure telemetry before AI executes. The AI reasoning engine is a **consumer** of scored evidence — it cannot modify or override deterministic results.
- **AI-generated content is clearly scoped.** The 11-pass reasoning pipeline produces advisory content (roadmaps, executive briefings, risk narratives). These outputs are labeled as AI-generated in the report and are always traceable to the underlying control evidence.
- **Microsoft Learn grounding.** Remediation recommendations are grounded in official Microsoft documentation via MCP retrieval — not synthesized from training data alone.

### Limitations

- **Automation coverage is partial.** Typically 20–30% of ALZ checklist controls have automated evaluators. The remaining controls are marked `Manual` and require customer conversation to resolve. The tool does not guess or infer results for manual controls.
- **AI reasoning depends on model quality.** The advisory output (roadmaps, risk narratives, smart questions) is generated by Azure OpenAI and may contain inaccuracies, incomplete reasoning, or hallucinated references — even with grounding. CSAs should review AI output before presenting to customers.
- **Point-in-time snapshot.** Assessment results reflect the Azure environment state at scan time. They do not represent continuous compliance and may become stale.
- **No multi-tenant isolation.** The tool runs under a single Azure identity. It does not enforce tenant boundaries — the operator is responsible for scoping access appropriately.

### Guardrails

| Guardrail | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| **No environment mutation** | All Azure API calls are read-only (Resource Graph queries, ARM GET, Policy read). No create/update/delete operations exist in the codebase. |
| **No scoring override** | Maturity scores are computed deterministically by the scoring engine. AI cannot alter control verdicts or weights. |
| **File confinement** | All generated artifacts are written to `out/`. The `ensure_out_path()` function rejects any path outside that directory. |
| **Format allow-list** | `generate_outputs` only accepts `html` and `excel` — arbitrary file formats are rejected. |
| **Schema validation** | AI responses are validated against JSON schemas before acceptance. Malformed output is rejected and retried. |
| **One-way data flow** | Deterministic results feed the AI layer. AI output never feeds back into the scoring engine. |
| **No data fabrication** | Every Copilot workshop response must be grounded in loaded assessment data. The session has no access to external data sources beyond what the tools provide. |

### Data Handling

- **No customer data is transmitted externally** metadata goes to Azure OpenAI (for AI reasoning) and Microsoft Learn (for documentation grounding). Both are Microsoft services.
- **No telemetry or usage data** is collected by this tool.
- **Assessment results** (including Azure resource metadata) are stored locally in `out/` and `assessment.json`
