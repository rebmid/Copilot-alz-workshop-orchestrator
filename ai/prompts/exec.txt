Translate the following technical assessment into a CIO/CTO-level executive briefing.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:

{
  "summary": "2-3 paragraph executive narrative. Lead with maturity posture, key risks, and investment thesis.",
  "top_business_risks": [
    {
      "title": "...",
      "business_impact": "What the business loses if unresolved",
      "technical_cause": "Root technical gap",
      "severity": "Critical | High | Medium",
      "affected_controls": ["control_id"]
    }
  ],
  "investment_priorities": [
    {
      "priority": 1,
      "initiative": "...",
      "estimated_effort": "...",
      "business_value": "..."
    }
  ],
  "expected_outcomes_90_days": [
    "Measurable outcome statement"
  ]
}

Rules:
- Audience is CIO / CTO — translate technical gaps into business risk language
- Never use task-based language. Lead with outcomes.
- Tie every risk to a business consequence: revenue, compliance, operational continuity, reputation
- Investment priorities should be ordered by risk reduction per effort
- 90-day outcomes must be concrete and measurable (e.g., "Policy compliance above 80%")
- Use execution_context.tenant_id and subscription info to contextualize
- If delta is provided, describe trend direction (improving, stagnating, regressing)
