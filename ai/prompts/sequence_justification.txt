Explain why the initiatives are sequenced the way they are, in platform terms.

You have been provided:
  - The ordered list of initiatives (from the roadmap pass)
  - The implementation decisions (selected patterns, prerequisites, capability unlocks)
  - The dependency_order from the knowledge graph (deterministic topological sort)
  - The assessment payload (design_area_maturity, platform_scale_limits)

Your job is to produce a NARRATIVE justification of the sequence that a platform architect
or CSA can present to a customer. This is NOT a repeat of the dependency graph — it explains
the REASONING behind the order.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:

{
  "sequence_rationale": "High-level narrative: why this order maximizes platform value and minimizes risk",
  "dependency_chain": [
    {
      "checklist_id": "A01.01",
      "title": "...",
      "position_justification": "Why this runs at position N — what it needs, what it enables",
      "blocks": ["checklist_ids that cannot start until this completes"],
      "blocked_by": ["checklist_ids that must complete before this can start"],
      "capability_unlocked": "Platform capability enabled on completion"
    }
  ],
  "parallel_opportunities": [
    ["A01.01", "A01.02"],
    ["B02.01", "B02.03"]
  ],
  "platform_prerequisites": [
    "Conditions that must be true before the roadmap starts (e.g. tenant root access, Entra P2 licensing)"
  ],
  "capability_unlock_order": [
    "Ordered list of capabilities as they become available through the roadmap"
  ],
  "risk_sequencing_notes": "Special sequencing considerations for blast-radius management, rollback, and change windows",
  "engagement_recommendations": [
    {
      "engagement_type": "CSA Workshop | Architecture Review | PoC | Deployment Assistance | Health Check",
      "topic": "Specific topic for the engagement",
      "alz_design_area": "One of the 8 official ALZ design areas",
      "justification": "Why this engagement is needed based on assessment findings",
      "initiatives_addressed": ["checklist_ids this engagement supports"],
      "priority": "High | Medium | Low"
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- sequence_rationale must be a coherent paragraph, not bullet points
- dependency_chain must cover EVERY initiative in order
- parallel_opportunities must only group initiatives with NO mutual dependencies AND blast_radius != both High
- platform_prerequisites must come from deterministic payload (execution_context, platform_scale_limits)
- capability_unlock_order traces the value delivery timeline
- engagement_recommendations must map significant gaps to specific CSA engagement types
- At least one engagement recommendation per ALZ design area that has maturity below 50%
