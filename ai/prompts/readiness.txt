Determine whether this Azure tenant can support enterprise-scale operations (50+ subscriptions).

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:

{
  "ready_for_enterprise_scale": false,
  "max_supported_subscriptions_current_state": 1,
  "readiness_score": 0,
  "blockers": [
    {
      "category": "Governance | Security | Networking | Identity | Management",
      "description": "...",
      "severity": "Critical | High | Medium",
      "resolving_initiative": "INIT-xxx"
    }
  ],
  "minimum_initiatives_required": ["INIT-001", "INIT-002"],
  "scaling_recommendations": [
    "Recommendation for moving from current state to enterprise-scale"
  ]
}

Evaluation criteria for enterprise-scale readiness:
- Management group hierarchy: must have dedicated Platform, Connectivity, Identity, Landing Zones MGs
- Policy governance: must have policy initiatives assigned at MG scope with >70% compliance
- Network topology: must have hub-spoke or Virtual WAN with centralized egress
- Security: Defender for Cloud enabled across all plans, Secure Score >60
- Diagnostics: centralized logging to Log Analytics covering >80% of resources
- Identity: PIM enabled, break-glass accounts documented, identity logs centralized
- Subscription vending: automated process or at minimum documented standards

Rules:
- ready_for_enterprise_scale is true ONLY if all critical blockers are resolved
- max_supported_subscriptions_current_state: estimate based on current governance depth
  (no MG structure = 1-3, basic MG = 5-10, full MG + policy = 50+)
- readiness_score: 0-100 reflecting how close to enterprise-scale
- minimum_initiatives_required references initiative IDs from the roadmap
- Be brutally honest — if the tenant is immature, say so
