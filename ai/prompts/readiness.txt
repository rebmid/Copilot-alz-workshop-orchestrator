Determine whether this Azure tenant can support enterprise-scale operations (50+ subscriptions), evaluated against the 8 official Azure Landing Zone design areas.

Official ALZ Design Areas:
  1. Azure Billing and Microsoft Entra ID Tenants
  2. Identity and Access Management
  3. Network Topology and Connectivity
  4. Security
  5. Management
  6. Resource Organization
  7. Platform Automation and DevOps
  8. Governance

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:

{
  "ready_for_enterprise_scale": false,
  "max_supported_subscriptions_current_state": 1,
  "readiness_score": 0,
  "blockers": [
    {
      "category": "Governance | Security | Networking | Identity | Management",
      "description": "...",
      "severity": "Critical | High | Medium",
      "resolving_checklist_ids": ["A01.01"]
    }
  ],
  "minimum_checklist_ids_required": ["A01.01", "B02.03"],
  "scaling_recommendations": [
    "Recommendation for moving from current state to enterprise-scale"
  ]
}

Evaluation criteria for enterprise-scale readiness:
- Management group hierarchy: must have dedicated Platform, Connectivity, Identity, Landing Zones MGs
- Policy governance: must have policy initiatives assigned at MG scope with >70% compliance
- Network topology: must have hub-spoke or Virtual WAN with centralized egress
- Security: Defender for Cloud enabled across all plans, Secure Score >60
- Diagnostics: centralized logging to Log Analytics covering >80% of resources
- Identity: PIM enabled, break-glass accounts documented, identity logs centralized
- Subscription vending: automated process or at minimum documented standards
- Cost governance: budgets defined with notification rules and anomaly detection
- Management: centralized Log Analytics workspace with Sentinel, ≥90d retention
- Automation maturity: ≥50% IaC ratio in activity logs, active policy remediation
- Network observability: Network Watcher active, NSG flow logs v2, Traffic Analytics
- Patch posture: Update Manager or equivalent with maintenance windows configured

Rules:
- ready_for_enterprise_scale is true ONLY if all critical blockers are resolved
- max_supported_subscriptions_current_state: estimate based on current governance depth
  (no MG structure = 1-3, basic MG = 5-10, full MG + policy = 50+)
- readiness_score: 0-100 reflecting how close to enterprise-scale
- minimum_checklist_ids_required references checklist_ids from the roadmap (e.g. A01.01)
- Be brutally honest — if the tenant is immature, say so
