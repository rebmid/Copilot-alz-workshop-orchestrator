Cluster the manual (unresolvable by automation) controls into the minimum number of high-impact questions.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:

{
  "smart_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Clear, actionable question for the customer",
      "type": "yes_no | selection | maturity_scale",
      "resolves_controls": ["control_id"],
      "impact_if_yes": "What changes in the assessment if the answer is positive",
      "impact_if_no": "What remains a gap if the answer is negative",
      "follow_up_recommendation": "What to do next based on either answer"
    }
  ],
  "question_count": 0,
  "controls_resolved": 0,
  "resolution_coverage_percent": 0
}

Rules:
- Minimum questions, maximum control resolution. Aim for <15 questions resolving >80% of manual controls.
- Group related manual controls into a single question where possible
  (e.g., all identity-related manual checks → one question about PIM/RBAC maturity)
- Each question must be answerable by a platform engineering lead or security architect
- type guides the UI:
  - yes_no: binary toggle
  - selection: pick from predefined options (include the options in the question)
  - maturity_scale: rate 1-5
- impact_if_yes / impact_if_no: describe exactly how the assessment posture changes
- Order questions by impact: highest control-resolution-count first
- Do not ask questions that the automated assessment already answered
- Do not ask about things that can be verified via Azure APIs

Assumption Resolution:
- When the automated assessment returns a "Manual" or low-confidence result, check if adjacent signals
  provide enough context to propose an assumption. If so, phrase the question to confirm or deny that assumption.
- For example: if workspace topology shows 1 workspace but Sentinel status is unknown, ask:
  "Is Microsoft Sentinel enabled on your centralized Log Analytics workspace?" (rather than a generic "Do you use Sentinel?")
- Tag each question with the confidence_score of the underlying signal that triggered it.
  Lower-confidence signals should generate higher-priority questions.

Conflict Resolution:
- If two signals conflict, generate a clarifying question that resolves the conflict.
  For example: "Activity logs show PIM activations, but Entra diagnostic settings show no sign-in logs forwarded.
  Which describes your current state: (a) PIM is active with logs sent to a different sink, (b) Logs are being forwarded
  but the diagnostic check had insufficient permissions, (c) PIM is not yet fully configured?"
