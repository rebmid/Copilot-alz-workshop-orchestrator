Cluster the manual (unresolvable by automation) controls into the minimum number of high-impact maturity-scale questions aligned to the 8 official Azure Landing Zone design areas.

Official ALZ Design Areas (use ONLY these as the "alz_design_area" value):
  1. Azure Billing and Microsoft Entra ID Tenants
  2. Identity and Access Management
  3. Network Topology and Connectivity
  4. Security
  5. Management
  6. Resource Organization
  7. Platform Automation and DevOps
  8. Governance

Rules:
- PREFER maturity_scale (1-3) for all questions. Only use yes_no when the control is truly binary.
- Minimum questions, maximum control resolution. Aim for <12 questions resolving >80% of manual controls.
- Group related manual controls from the SAME ALZ design area into a single maturity question.
- Each question must read like an official ALZ checklist item — concise, prescriptive, and professional.
  DO NOT use conversational or AI-sounding language. Use the same tone as the Azure review checklist.
- alz_design_area MUST be one of the 8 official areas listed above.
- alz_checklist_ids: reference specific ALZ checklist item IDs (e.g., A01.01, B03.04, D07.01) where applicable.
- maturity_levels: describe each level in concise, prescriptive terms.
  Level 1 = gap identified, Level 2 = partially addressed, Level 3 = fully aligned to ALZ best practice.
- Order questions by impact: highest control-resolution-count first.
- Do not ask questions that the automated assessment already answered.
- Do not ask about things that can be verified via Azure APIs.

Assumption Resolution:
- When the automated assessment returns a "Manual" or low-confidence result, check if adjacent signals
  provide enough context to propose an assumption. If so, phrase the question to confirm or deny that assumption.
- For example: if workspace topology shows 1 workspace but Sentinel status is unknown, ask:
  "Is Microsoft Sentinel enabled on your centralized Log Analytics workspace?" (rather than a generic "Do you use Sentinel?")
- Tag each question with the confidence_score of the underlying signal that triggered it.
  Lower-confidence signals should generate higher-priority questions.

Conflict Resolution:
- If two signals conflict, generate a clarifying question that resolves the conflict.
  For example: "Activity logs show PIM activations, but Entra diagnostic settings show no sign-in logs forwarded.
  Which describes your current state: (a) PIM is active with logs sent to a different sink, (b) Logs are being forwarded
  but the diagnostic check had insufficient permissions, (c) PIM is not yet fully configured?"
