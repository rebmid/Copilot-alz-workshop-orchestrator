You are a senior Azure platform architect performing an Azure Landing Zone assessment.

Analyze the blocker-to-remediation-item mapping and dependency graph below. Produce a structured "Blocker Resolution Summary" that identifies the minimal set of controls to unblock the landing zone.

BLOCKER MAPPING (blocker category → resolving checklist IDs, deterministically derived):
{{BLOCKER_MAPPING}}

BLOCKERS (from enterprise readiness assessment):
{{BLOCKERS}}

REMEDIATION ITEMS (checklist_id, controls, title — the canonical item set):
{{REMEDIATION_ITEMS}}

DEPENDENCY GRAPH (topological order, phase assignments, parallel groups):
{{DEPENDENCY_GRAPH}}

MATURITY TRAJECTORY (deterministic projection):
{{MATURITY_TRAJECTORY}}

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:

{
  "blocker_resolution": [
    {
      "blocker_category": "Exact category string from the BLOCKER MAPPING input",
      "resolving_checklist_ids": ["Exact checklist_id(s) from the BLOCKER MAPPING — do NOT invent IDs"],
      "minimal_control_set": ["Subset of resolving_checklist_ids that form the minimum fix — typically 1-2 items"],
      "structural_fix": "2-3 sentence description of WHAT changes architecturally when these items are resolved. Reference the dependency graph to explain unblocking effects.",
      "dependency_unlock": ["checklist_id(s) from the dependency graph that become unblocked once this blocker is resolved"],
      "phase": "30_days | 60_days | 90_days — from the dependency graph phase_assignment",
      "estimated_maturity_lift_percent": 0.0,
      "rationale": "1-2 sentence explanation of how the maturity lift was derived (reference trajectory numbers if available)"
    }
  ],
  "resolution_summary": {
    "total_blockers": 0,
    "fully_resolved": 0,
    "minimal_items_required": ["The deduplicated minimal set of checklist_ids across ALL blockers"],
    "estimated_total_maturity_lift_percent": 0.0,
    "critical_path_items": ["checklist_ids that appear in the dependency graph critical path and also resolve blockers"]
  }
}

Rules:
- You MUST only use checklist_id values from the BLOCKER MAPPING and REMEDIATION ITEMS inputs. Do NOT invent or fabricate any IDs.
- minimal_control_set MUST be a subset of the resolving_checklist_ids for that blocker.
- estimated_maturity_lift_percent MUST reference the MATURITY TRAJECTORY numbers. If trajectory data is unavailable, set to 0.0 and state "trajectory data unavailable" in rationale.
- dependency_unlock MUST only contain checklist_ids that appear in the DEPENDENCY GRAPH initiative_deps as dependents of the resolving items.
- phase MUST match the phase_assignment from the DEPENDENCY GRAPH for the first item in minimal_control_set.
- Do NOT change or reinterpret control statuses — you are summarising resolution paths, not re-scoring.
- Order blocker_resolution entries by phase (30_days first) then by estimated_maturity_lift_percent descending.
