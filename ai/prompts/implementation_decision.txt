For each initiative in the roadmap, select the correct ALZ implementation pattern and justify the choice.

You have been provided:
  - The initiative (title, controls, alz_design_area, capability_unlocked)
  - Available ALZ implementation options retrieved from Microsoft Learn (via MCP)
  - The assessment payload (design_area_maturity, platform_scale_limits, signal_confidence)

Your job is to SELECT one pattern per initiative and JUSTIFY the selection against the evidence.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema:

{
  "implementation_decisions": [
    {
      "initiative_id": "INIT-001",
      "initiative_title": "...",
      "recommended_pattern": "The pattern_name from the options list",
      "alz_module": "The ALZ Bicep module path (e.g. ALZ-Bicep/modules/hubNetworking)",
      "why_this_pattern": "Evidence-based justification: why this pattern over alternatives, referencing assessment data",
      "prerequisites_met": ["List of prerequisites that the assessment confirms are already in place"],
      "prerequisites_missing": ["List of prerequisites that must be addressed first"],
      "sequence_justification": "Why this initiative should run at its proposed position in the roadmap",
      "operating_model_impact": "Who runs this, what operational changes are required, steady-state ownership",
      "capability_unlocked": "What becomes possible when this completes — the platform capability enabled",
      "next_engagement_alignment": "CSA engagement type this maps to (Workshop, Architecture Review, PoC, Deployment Assistance)"
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Select EXACTLY ONE pattern per initiative from the provided options
- If no provided option fits, describe a custom pattern but still reference ALZ modules
- Justify every selection with SPECIFIC assessment evidence (section scores, gap IDs, maturity data)
- Prerequisites must reference real initiative IDs or platform conditions
- capability_unlocked must describe a CONCRETE platform outcome, not a generic benefit
- operating_model_impact must name specific roles (Platform Engineering, Security, Identity, Network)
- next_engagement_alignment must be one of: CSA Workshop, Architecture Review, PoC, Deployment Assistance, Health Check
